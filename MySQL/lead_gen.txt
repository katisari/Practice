1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

SELECT 
    MONTHNAME(charged_datetime), SUM(amount)
FROM
    billing
WHERE
    MONTHNAME(charged_datetime) = 'march'
        AND YEAR(charged_datetime) = 2012;

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?

SELECT clients.client_id, SUM(billing.amount) FROM clients
LEFT JOIN billing ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id = 2;

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?

SELECT sites.domain_name as website, clients.client_id
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id = 10;

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?

SELECT clients.client_id,  COUNT(sites.site_id) as number_of_websites, MONTHNAME(created_datetime) as month_created, YEAR(created_datetime) as year_created
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id = 1
GROUP BY month_created, year_created;

5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

SELECT sites.domain_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads, DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, "%M %d, %Y") AS date_generated FROM sites
JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime >= '2011/01/01' AND leads.registered_datetime <= '2011/02/15'
GROUP BY sites.domain_name

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?

SELECT concat(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) FROM clients
JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime >= '2011/01/01' AND leads.registered_datetime <= '2011/12/31'
GROUP BY clients.client_id;

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?

SELECT concat(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id), MONTHNAME(leads.registered_datetime) AS month_generated FROM clients
JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE YEAR(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011 AND MONTH(leads.registered_datetime) >= 1 AND MONTH(leads.registered_datetime) <= 6
GROUP BY month_generated, clients.client_id;

8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.

SELECT 
    CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name,
    sites.domain_name,
    COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS number_of_leads
FROM
    clients
		JOIN
    sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
        JOIN
    leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE
    leads.registered_datetime >= '2011/01/01'
        AND leads.registered_datetime <= '2011/12/31'
GROUP BY clients.client_id, sites.site_id;

#2 version

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, sites.domain_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS number_of_leads FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id, sites.domain_name

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.

SELECT concat(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name),
	SUM(billing.amount) AS total_revenue,
    MONTHNAME(billing.charged_datetime) AS month_charge,
			YEAR(billing.charged_datetime) AS year_charge
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN billing ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id, YEAR(billing.charged_datetime),MONTHNAME(billing.charged_datetime) 

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, GROUP_CONCAT(sites.domain_name SEPARATOR ' / ')
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id;
